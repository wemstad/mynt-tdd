# TDD Adventure 🚀

Welcome to the **Todo Quest**, brave developer! 🧙‍♂️✨

The kingdom of **Tasklandia** is in chaos, and its citizens are crying out for a hero. The Product Owner, Sir Stressed-a-Lot, has summoned you to the royal court. His hair is frazzled, his coffee cup is empty, and his voice trembles as he speaks:

> "Oh, valiant coder! Our beloved task manager is in shambles! The users are revolting, the features are broken, and the bugs... oh, the bugs! We need you to fix this mess and restore order to Tasklandia. But beware, the mighty CTO, Captain TeDDious, has decreed that every line of code must be forged in the fires of **Test-Driven Development**. No shortcuts, no excuses!"

Captain TeDDious steps forward, his gaze as sharp as a freshly written `assert`. He raises his testing staff and declares:

> "Listen well, developer. In this land, no feature shall pass without a test. Every bug you squash, every feature you build, must be accompanied by a suite of tests to ensure its worthiness. Only then will Tasklandia thrive once more."

With that, your quest begins. Here are the challenges that lie ahead:

### Your Epic To-Do List:
1. 🧮 **Task Tally Trouble**: The citizens demand a counter to show how many tasks remain. Can you craft this magical tally?
2. ✅ **Checkbox Chaos**: The "completed" checkbox is cursed and refuses to work. Break the spell and restore its power!
3. ✏️❌ **Edit & Delete Drama**: Editing and deleting tasks have fallen into disrepair. Revive these features and bring balance to the task list.
4. ➕ **Add-a-Task Adventure**: The people wish to add new tasks to their lists. Grant them this ability and watch their productivity soar!
5. 🔀 **Sort It Out**: Tasks are scattered like leaves in the wind. Create a sorting spell to make unfinished tasks rise to the top like true heroes.
6. 🔍 **Filter Frenzy**: Why can everyone see *all* the tasks? Add a filter to show only tasks for `userIds` > or < 100. Privacy is key!
7. 🎉 **Celebrate Good Times**: When all tasks are completed, the citizens want to celebrate. Add a little confetti magic to mark their triumphs! 🎊

### The Rules of the Quest:
- Every feature must be built using **TDD**. Write the test, watch it fail, then make it pass. Captain TeDDious will accept nothing less.
- All tasks must be completed using **mob programming**. Gather your team, share the keyboard, and let collaboration lead the way.
- Beware of sneaky bugs and edge cases—they lurk in the shadows, waiting to strike.

Sir Stressed-a-Lot hands you a scroll with the list of tasks, his eyes filled with hope. Captain TeDDious nods approvingly. The fate of Tasklandia rests in your hands.

Let the coding journey begin! 🧙‍♂️✨
